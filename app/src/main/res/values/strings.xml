    <string name="desc0">    A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after

        leading India to glory in the Under-19 World

        Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008. In an Indian team filled with saint-like

        icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli,

    <string name="desc1">Languid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the

        shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai

        suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence,

        but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most

        formidable league team in the first age of T20.</string>
